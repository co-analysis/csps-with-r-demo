# csps-with-r-demo

## Purpose

This repository is to support people in 'The CSPS with R and RStudio session' on Tuesday 18 February 2020 who do not have R or RStudio installed, or are unable to install packages or download the data.

In the session we'll be following along with this document: https://co-analysis.github.io/csps-with-r/

## RStudio in the cloud

If you don't have R and RStudio installed, you can click the 'Launch RStudio Binder' button below to open RStudio in the cloud, which you will access from your browser.

<!-- badges: end -->

This is not how you would normally access RStudio; this has been set up so you are able to follow along with the demonstrations in the session.

Note that anything you create will not be preserved. You will need to copy, paste and save anything you write into a file on your computer instead.

## Folder structure

There's lots of files and folders in this repository that you don't need to worry about. You should consider the 

```
csps-with-r-demo/              # the project folder
  ├── csps-with-r-demo.Rproj   # R Project file
  ├── data/                    # read-only raw data
  └── output/                  # processed data goes here
```

You can save your R script files (.R) under `csps-with-r-demo/`.
